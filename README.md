## Project

This project was built using create-react-app. To launch the app use `npm start`.

### Structure

The frontend was built using bulma. bulma, moment, and axios were imported using npm and compiled using webpack which react-create-app uses in the background. 

### Ways to launch

1. Visit public/index.html to view the project.

2. If npm is installed running 'npm start' will launch the application and open a browser tab for it. This way is best for development. I had to delete the node_modules folder to be able to email it so run 'npm install' first.

3. You can also run the application by visiting the build folder but it needs to be served by a server and the build folder needs to be the server root. This is the production build that react-create-app generates
