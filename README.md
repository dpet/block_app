## Project

This project was built using create-react-app. To launch the app use `npm start`.

### Structure

The frontend was built using bulma. bulma, moment, and axios were imported using npm and compiled using webpack which react-create-app uses in the background. 

### Launch

If npm is installed running 'npm start' will launch the application and open a browser tab for it. 

You can also run the application by visiting the build folder but it needs to be served by a server and the build folder needs to be the server root.
